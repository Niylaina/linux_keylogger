# linux_keylogger

**DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for anything evil you do with this thing.**

usage: python keylogger.py [cancel_key] [keylogger_clean]

i.e add 'cancel_key' without quotes if you want to use a custom cancel key because ctrl+c doesn't work sometimes (set it in the keylogger.py)

Requires python-xlib.

install it via pip:

<code>pip install python-xlib</code>

or via your package manager, eg:

<code>sudo apt-get install python-xlib</code>

**Doesn't work on windows. There are already many out there**
